# ASCII graph

The Scheme code parses an ASCII Art graphics into an S-Expression format 
that can be written to an SVG file for example. An ASCII Graph is 
something like this:

   +------------+
   |            |
   |  Hello     +----->+---------+
   |            |      |         |
   +------------+      +---------+

There still remains some issues in the code, but the base is here.
